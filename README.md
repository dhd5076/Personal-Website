# The TRP Backup

A browsable backup of the TRP subreddit. With a recent quarantine and a ban on the horizon this serves as a alternative in case the reddit
admins decide to completly censor TRP.

Disclaimer: The views expresssed in the backed up content aren't neccessarily that of the author. My primary goal is to preserve free speech
and prevent censorship of potentially controversial ideas not to promote any set of beliefs.
